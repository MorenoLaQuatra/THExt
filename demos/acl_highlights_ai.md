# [How Knowledge Graph and Attention Help? A Quantitative Analysis into Bag-level Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.359/)
- To quantitatively evaluate the effect of attention and KG on Bag-level RE, we first define two metrics to measure the noise pattern (Section 4.1).

- To evaluate the effects of attention and KG, we design two straightforward Bag-level RE models without the attention module, BRE and BRE+CE.

- In conclusion, we construct a set of datasets and propose a framework to quantitatively evaluate how attention module and KG work in the bag-level RE.

- We summarize our contributions as follows: • To the best of our knowledge, our proposed framework is the first work to quantitatively analyze the working mechanism of Knowledge Graph and attention for bag-level RE. 1 dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/20201109/ • We have conducted extensive experiments to inspire and support us with the above findings.




# [Which Linguist Invented the Lightbulb? Presupposition Verification for Question-Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.304/)
- Presuppositions and unanswerability.

- • We propose a novel framework for handling presuppositions in QA, breaking down the problem into three parts (see steps above), and evaluate progress on each (S5).

- This is the oracle behavior of closed-book QA systems that allow Unanswerable as an answer.

- This supports our hypothesis that presupposition failure-based answers would be more satisfactory to the users, and suggests that building a QA system that approaches the oracle behavior of our proposed system is a worthwhile pursuit.

# [Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.91/)
- Some of our findings are: (1) models trained with more data rely on source information more and have more sharp token contributions; (2) the training process is non-monotonic with several distinct stages.

- We can see that, generally, models trained with more data rely on source more heavily.

- When analyzing the training process, we find that changes in training are non-monotonic and form several distinct stages (e.g., stages changing direction from decreasing influence of source to increasing).

- Now we turn to analyzing the training process of an NMT model.

# [Good for Misconceived Reasons: An Empirical Revisiting on the Need for Visual Context in Multimodal Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.480/)
- First, we revisit the need for visual context in the popular task of multimodal machine translation and find that: (1) under sufficient textual context, the MMT models' improvements over text-only counterparts result from the regularization effect (Section 5.2).

- In this paper we devise two interpretable models that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the widely adopted MMT datasets -Multi30k and the new video-based dataset -VaTex.

- Inspecting the results, we find that applying these regularization techniques achieves similar gains over the text-only baseline as incorporating multimodal information does.

- We first give a brief introduction to adversarial attacks in NLP before showing how they can be used for reliability testing.

- We argue that reliability testing, by reframing the concept of adversarial attacks, has the potential to fill this gap.

- Dropped pronoun recovery is a critical technique that can benefit many downstream applications

- For human incremental processing data, we use by-word reaction times (RTs).

- We find that models systematically under-predict the observed human data.

- We combine these two approaches with a targeted assessment of incremental processing in neural language models and humans.

- Do differences in surprisal accurately predict the slowdowns observed in human reaction time data?




# [Generating Query Focused Summaries from Query-Free Resources](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.475/)
- In this work we proposed an abstractive framework for query focused summarization.

- In this work, we propose to decompose QFS into two sub-tasks, namely query modeling and conditional language modeling.

- Under this formulation, we use generic summarization data not only for conditional language modeling, but also for learning an evidence ranking model.

- Experimental results across datasets show that the proposed system yields state-of-the-art performance despite the weakly supervised setting, and produces more relevant and coherent summaries compared to existing approaches.




# [The statistical advantage of automatic NLG metrics at the system level](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.533/)
- With the decomposition, we can adjust metric errors estimates to a noise-free and infinite test set setting by taking only their bias component.

- Note that this term is also the true error of a metric estimator in a noise-free, infinite test set setting.

- With the bias-variance-noise decomposition, we can adjust our observed error estimates to the noise-free, infinite test set setting of the true error.

- Our bias-variance-noise decomposition shows that the observed pairwise accuracy is very close to the true pairwise accuracy from a noise-free, infinite test set setting ( §4.4).




# [AdvPicker: Effectively Leveraging Unlabeled Data via Adversarial Discriminator for Cross-Lingual NER](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.61/)
- Language-Independent Data To leverage such less language-dependent data

- Specifically, we first train an encoder and a NER classifier on labeled source-language data to learn entity domain knowledge.

- Our experimental results show that the proposed method benefits strongly from this data selection process and outperforms existing SOTA methods; without requiring any additional external resources (e.g., gazetteers or machine translation).

- Furthermore, to address the described problems, we enhance the source-language NER model with unlabeled target language data via adversarial training.




# [Syntax-augmented Multilingual BERT for Cross-lingual Transfer](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.350/)
- 1. Does augmenting mBERT with syntax improve (generalized) cross-lingual transfer?

- Our main idea is to augment mBERT with language syntax for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

- We highlight the cross-lingual transfer gap for mBERT and syntax-augmented mBERT on the evaluation tasks in Table 7.

- Experiment results show that augmenting mBERT with syntax improves cross-lingual transfer, such as in PAWS-X and MLQA, by 1.4 and 1.6 points on average across all the target languages.




# [Dual Graph Convolutional Networks for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.494/)
- • We propose orthogonal and differential regularizers.

- To improve the semantic representation, we propose two regularizers for the SemGCN module, i.e., orthogonal and differential regularizers.

- Our contributions are highlighted as follows: • We propose a DualGCN model for the ABSA task.

- Therefore, the dependency probability matrix is used to alleviate dependency parsing errors.




# [Answering Ambiguous Questions through Generative Evidence Fusion and Round-Trip Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.253/)
- The proposed round-trip prediction is a general approach for answering ambiguous open-domain questions, which improves our REFUEL as well as several baseline models.

- Finally, we propose a round-trip prediction approach to find additional interpretations that RE-FUEL fails to predict in the first pass.

- To address these issues, we propose REFUEL, Round-trip Evidence FUsion via gEneration with retrievaL, a new framework for answering ambiguous open-domain questions.

- Finally, the proposed round-trip prediction is a model-agnostic general approach for answering ambiguous questions, which improves our REFUEL as well as several baseline models up to 3.7% for the overall performance.




# [Inter-GPS: Interpretable Geometry Problem Solving with Formal Language and Symbolic Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.528/)
- Datasets for Geometry Problem Solving.

- This paper further presents a novel geometry solving approach with formal language and symbolic reasoning, called Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS).

- Approaches for Geometry Problem Solving.

- Therefore, we build a new large-scale geometry problem benchmark, called Geometry3K.
