# [How Knowledge Graph and Attention Help? A Quantitative Analysis into Bag-level Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.359/)
- To quantitatively evaluate the effect of attention and KG on Bag-level RE, we first define two metrics to measure the noise pattern (Section 4.1).

- To evaluate the effects of attention and KG, we design two straightforward Bag-level RE models without the attention module, BRE and BRE+CE.

- Bag-level relation extraction (RE) takes a bag of sentences B = {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s m } as input.

- We summarize our contributions as follows: • To the best of our knowledge, our proposed framework is the first work to quantitatively analyze the working mechanism of Knowledge Graph and attention for bag-level RE. 1 dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/20201109/ • We have conducted extensive experiments to inspire and support us with the above findings.

# [Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.91/)
- Some of our findings are: (1) models trained with more data rely on source information more and have more sharp token contributions; (2) the training process is non-monotonic with several distinct stages.

- Now we turn to analyzing the training process of an NMT model.

- When analyzing the training process, we find that changes in training are non-monotonic and form several distinct stages (e.g., stages changing direction from decreasing influence of source to increasing).

- We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes (reference, generated by a model or random translations), when varying training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process.

- The main contributions are listed as follows: • We propose a novel topic-aware evidence reasoning and stance-aware aggregation approach, which is, to our best knowledge, the first attempt of jointly exploiting semantic interaction and topical consistency to learn latent evidence representation for fact verification.

- Specifically, to incorporate the topical coherence among multiple pieces of evidence into our model, we disregard the order of evidence and treat each evidence independently.

- Therefore, two kinds of topical relationship are considered: 1) topical coherence among multiple pieces of evidence (T C ee ); 2) topical consistency between the claim and each evidence (T C ce ).

- Experimental results across datasets show that the proposed system yields state-of-the-art performance despite the weakly supervised setting, and produces more relevant and coherent summaries compared to existing approaches.




# [The statistical advantage of automatic NLG metrics at the system level](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.533/)
- With the decomposition, we can adjust metric errors estimates to a noise-free and infinite test set setting by taking only their bias component.

- Note that this term is also the true error of a metric estimator in a noise-free, infinite test set setting.

- Through rigorous comparison between metrics, humans, and the perfect segment-level annotator, we identify the settings where metrics outperform humans due to a statistical advantage in variance.

- With the bias-variance-noise decomposition, we can adjust our observed error estimates to the noise-free, infinite test set setting of the true error.




# [AdvPicker: Effectively Leveraging Unlabeled Data via Adversarial Discriminator for Cross-Lingual NER](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.61/)
- Specifically, we first train an encoder and a NER classifier on labeled source-language data to learn entity domain knowledge.

- Translation-based methods generally use pseudo target-language data translated from labeled sourcelanguage data.

- Language-Independent Data To leverage such less language-dependent data

- Our experimental results show that the proposed method benefits strongly from this data selection process and outperforms existing SOTA methods; without requiring any additional external resources (e.g., gazetteers or machine translation).




# [Syntax-augmented Multilingual BERT for Cross-lingual Transfer](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.350/)
- 1. Does augmenting mBERT with syntax improve (generalized) cross-lingual transfer?

- Our main idea is to augment mBERT with language syntax for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

- The results endorse the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the cross-lingual transfer.

- We highlight the cross-lingual transfer gap for mBERT and syntax-augmented mBERT on the evaluation tasks in Table 7.




# [Dual Graph Convolutional Networks for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.494/)
- • We propose orthogonal and differential regularizers.

- Our contributions are highlighted as follows: • We propose a DualGCN model for the ABSA task.

- To improve the semantic representation, we propose two regularizers for the SemGCN module, i.e., orthogonal and differential regularizers.

- Therefore, the dependency probability matrix is used to alleviate dependency parsing errors.




# [Answering Ambiguous Questions through Generative Evidence Fusion and Round-Trip Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.253/)
- The proposed round-trip prediction is a general approach for answering ambiguous open-domain questions, which improves our REFUEL as well as several baseline models.

- REFUEL achieves a new state-of-the-art on AM-BIGQA, and shows competitive performance on NQ-OPEN and TriviaQA.

- To address these issues, we propose REFUEL, Round-trip Evidence FUsion via gEneration with retrievaL, a new framework for answering ambiguous open-domain questions.

- ( 3) We propose a model-agnostic round-trip prediction approach to find more interpretations missed in the first prediction pass, which we further refine using a conditional-probability-based filtering approach.

- Therefore, we build a new large-scale geometry problem benchmark, called Geometry3K.

- Datasets for Geometry Problem Solving.

- Approaches for Geometry Problem Solving.

- To overcome these challenges, we first construct a new large-scale benchmark, called Geometry3K, to assess algorithms' performance of geometry problem solving.
